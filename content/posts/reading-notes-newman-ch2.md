## Introduction

Chapter 2 of Newman's *Networks: An Introduction* focuses on **technological networks** - the man-made infrastructure networks that form the backbone of modern society. These networks exhibit fascinating structural properties that differ significantly from random networks, with important implications for their design, operation, and robustness.

## 2.1 The Internet

### Network Structure

The Internet is a **hierarchical network** with multiple layers:

- **Physical layer**: Fiber optic cables, routers, switches
- **Logical layer**: IP addresses and routing protocols
- **Application layer**: Web servers, email servers, etc.

### Topological Properties

#### Degree Distribution

The Internet's degree distribution follows a **power law**:

$$P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$$

Where $\gamma \approx 2.2$ for the Internet router network.

#### Mathematical Analysis

For a power-law distribution with exponent $\gamma$:

- **First moment** (average degree): $\langle k \rangle = \int_{k_{\min}}^{\infty} k \cdot P(k) \, dk$
- **Second moment**: $\langle k^2 \rangle = \int_{k_{\min}}^{\infty} k^2 \cdot P(k) \, dk$

When $\gamma < 3$, the second moment diverges, indicating **scale-free behavior**.

#### Real-World Measurements

- **AS-level network**: ~50,000 autonomous systems
- **Router-level network**: ~200,000 routers
- **Average degree**: ~3-4 connections per router
- **Clustering coefficient**: ~0.3 (much higher than random networks)

### Robustness Analysis

#### Random Failures

The Internet exhibits **robustness against random failures**:

$$P_{\text{connectivity}} = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle}\right)$$

#### Targeted Attacks

However, it's **vulnerable to targeted attacks** on high-degree nodes:

- Removing top 1% of nodes can fragment the network
- **Critical infrastructure** (major ISPs) are prime targets

## 2.2 Power Grids

### Network Representation

Power grids can be modeled as networks where:

- **Nodes**: Power plants, substations, transformers
- **Edges**: Transmission lines, distribution lines
- **Weights**: Electrical capacity, impedance

### Structural Properties

#### Hierarchical Organization

Power grids exhibit **three-tier hierarchy**:

1. **Transmission network**: High-voltage long-distance lines
2. **Sub-transmission network**: Medium-voltage regional distribution
3. **Distribution network**: Low-voltage local distribution

#### Mathematical Modeling

The **electrical flow** through the network follows Kirchhoff's laws:

$$\sum_{j} I_{ij} = 0 \quad \text{(current conservation)}$$

$$\sum_{\text{loop}} V_{ij} = 0 \quad \text{(voltage conservation)}$$

Where $I_{ij}$ is current and $V_{ij}$ is voltage between nodes $i$ and $j$.

### Cascading Failures

#### Load Redistribution Model

When a line fails, its load redistributes to other lines:

$$L_i(t+1) = L_i(t) + \sum_{j \in \text{failed}} \frac{L_j(t)}{|\text{neighbors}(j)|}$$

#### Critical Threshold

The system becomes unstable when:

$$\frac{\text{total load}}{\text{total capacity}} > \theta_c$$

Where $\theta_c \approx 0.6$ for typical power grids.

### Real-World Examples

#### North American Power Grid

- **Nodes**: ~15,000 substations
- **Edges**: ~20,000 transmission lines
- **Average degree**: ~2.7
- **Clustering coefficient**: ~0.08

#### European Power Grid

- **Nodes**: ~3,000 substations
- **Edges**: ~4,000 transmission lines
- **Average degree**: ~2.7
- **Clustering coefficient**: ~0.1

## 2.3 Transportation Networks

### Road Networks

#### Network Properties

- **Nodes**: Intersections, highway interchanges
- **Edges**: Road segments
- **Weights**: Travel time, distance, capacity

#### Scale-Free Characteristics

Many road networks exhibit **scale-free properties**:

- **Highway networks**: $\gamma \approx 2.0-2.5$
- **Urban road networks**: $\gamma \approx 2.5-3.0$

#### Efficiency Metrics

**Network efficiency** measures how well the network facilitates movement:

$$E = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{1}{d_{ij}}$$

Where $d_{ij}$ is the shortest path length between nodes $i$ and $j$.

### Airline Networks

#### Hub-and-Spoke Structure

Airlines use **hub-and-spoke topology**:

- **Hub airports**: Major connection points (high degree)
- **Spoke airports**: Regional airports (low degree)
- **Scale-free distribution**: $\gamma \approx 1.8-2.2$

#### Mathematical Analysis

The **betweenness centrality** of a node measures its importance as a connector:

$$C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$$

Where $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of shortest paths between $s$ and $t$ that pass through $v$.

### Railway Networks

#### Network Characteristics

- **Nodes**: Stations, junctions
- **Edges**: Railway tracks
- **Weights**: Travel time, frequency

#### Small-World Properties

Railway networks often exhibit **small-world characteristics**:

- **High clustering**: Stations in the same region are well-connected
- **Short path lengths**: Efficient long-distance connections

## 2.4 Communication Networks

### Telephone Networks

#### Historical Evolution

- **Circuit-switched networks**: Traditional telephone systems
- **Packet-switched networks**: Modern IP-based systems
- **Mobile networks**: Cellular infrastructure

#### Network Topology

Traditional telephone networks have **hierarchical structure**:

1. **Local exchanges**: Connect to subscribers
2. **Tandem exchanges**: Connect local exchanges
3. **Toll exchanges**: Long-distance connections

### Mobile Networks

#### Cellular Architecture

- **Base stations**: Network nodes
- **Cells**: Coverage areas
- **Handoffs**: Dynamic edge creation/deletion

#### Mathematical Modeling

The **coverage area** of a base station follows:

$$A = \pi R^2$$

Where $R$ is the cell radius, determined by:

$$R = \sqrt{\frac{P_t G_t G_r \lambda^2}{(4\pi)^2 P_r}}$$

- $P_t$: Transmit power
- $G_t, G_r$: Antenna gains
- $\lambda$: Wavelength
- $P_r$: Required received power

## 2.5 Applications to Materials Science

### Nanowire Networks

#### Network Formation

Silver nanowire networks can be modeled as **random geometric graphs**:

- **Nodes**: Nanowire junctions
- **Edges**: Nanowire segments
- **Weights**: Electrical resistance

#### Percolation Theory

The **percolation threshold** determines when the network becomes conductive:

$$p_c = \frac{1}{\langle k \rangle}$$

For nanowire networks, this corresponds to the **critical density** for electrical connectivity.

#### Electrical Properties

The **conductivity** of the network follows:

$$\sigma \sim (p - p_c)^t$$

Where $t \approx 2.0$ is the **conductivity exponent**.

### Smart Materials

#### Self-Assembling Networks

Materials that form networks through **self-assembly**:

- **Block copolymers**: Form ordered network structures
- **Liquid crystals**: Create defect networks
- **Colloidal systems**: Generate percolating networks

            G_temp = G.copy()
            G_temp.remove_nodes_from(nodes_to_remove)
            if G_temp.number_of_nodes() > 0:

                random_removal.append(len(largest_cc) / n)
            else:
